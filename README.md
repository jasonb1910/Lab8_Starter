# Lab 8 - Starter

### Jason Bui

1. I would run my automated tests for my Recipe project within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed because by testing each time new code is added, I can find and fix any issues right away.Then, if the code of my team is tested, it can make working together easier. It can also help ensure the code is of good quality.
2. No, to check if a function is returning the correct output, I should use unit tests, not end-to-end tests.
3. Yes, unit tests can test individual parts of the "message" feature. But to fully test the feature, I also need integration tests and end-to-end tests.
4. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because it checks a specific, isolated function of the application.
